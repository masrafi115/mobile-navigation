This was the project I started when I was just beginner. Aim was to create a PHP code outliner for web based interface. I extracted the atom  extension source code of coffescript and converted to javascript and now its wrecking. Now I don't even know what these code does.

**Based on: https://github.com/php-integrator/atom-navigation**

**Notably:** The Point and Range Class I Directly Copied from Atom Documentation and Its Source is Available. But the TextEditor Object(text-editor.js) is very heavy depending on lots of other modules and objects. so I decided to stopping this now. Though it was curiousity and i got the point.
